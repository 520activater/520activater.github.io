## Group influence recognition based on causal inference and graph neural network  
*8/2024 â€“ 6/2026*  
- Supported by the **National Undergraduate Training Program on Innovation and Entrepreneurship** *(Principle Investigator)*.
- Developed a novel framework combining casual learning theory and graph neural networks to evaluate group influence in social networks, enhancing robustness and interpretability.
### Research stages
<div style="text-align: left;">
1. Utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to derive node embeddings (current stage)
2. Integrate Causal Inference to extract more meaningful node features
3. Aggregate group representations from node embeddings
</div>

### Current Contributions
<div style="text-align: left;">
Develop an Autoencoder leveraging adjacent reconstruction and embedding similarity to derive robust node features for influence prediction.
</div

I am scheduled to present a contribution report in [the 3rd Joint Conference on Statistics and Data Science in China](https://www.jconf-sds.com/)
