## Group influence recognition based on causal inference and graph neural network  
*8/2024 â€“ 6/2026*  
- Supported by the **National Undergraduate Training Program on Innovation and Entrepreneurship** *(Principle Investigator)*.
- Developed a novel framework combining casual learning theory and graph neural networks to evaluate group influence in social networks, enhancing robustness and interpretability.
### Three research stage
1. Employ GNN to obtain node embeddings (current stage)
2. Incorporate Causal Inference to extract more reasonable node feature
3. Aggregate group representation from node embeddings
### Existing Contribution
Create an Autoencoder based on adjacent reconstruction and embeddings similarity to obtain sound node features used for node influence prediction.

I am scheduled to present a contribution report in [the 3rd Joint Conference on Statistics and Data Science in China](https://www.jconf-sds.com/)
