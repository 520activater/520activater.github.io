## Group influence recognition based on causal inference and graph neural network  
Period: 08/2024 â€“-- 06/2026  
- Supported by the **National Undergraduate Training Program on Innovation and Entrepreneurship** *(Principle Investigator)*.
- Developed a novel framework combining casual learning theory and graph neural networks to evaluate group influence in social networks, enhancing robustness and interpretability.

### Research stages
1. Utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to derive node embeddings (current stage)
2. Integrate Causal Inference to extract more meaningful node features
3. Aggregate group representations from node embeddings

### Current Contributions
Develop an Autoencoder leveraging adjacent reconstruction and embedding similarity to derive efficient node features for influence prediction.


I am scheduled to present a contribution report in [the 3rd Joint Conference on Statistics and Data Science in China](https://www.jconf-sds.com/)
